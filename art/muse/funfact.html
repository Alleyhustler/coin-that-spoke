                    <details><summary>unleash the thought process</summary><p>holy shit a haiku!!!!!<br>everything in the news was so sad. and then i thought. it doesnt have to be. and i found a short review of the movie holland, with nicole kidman. the writer of the article, a dutch person, was not a fan for various reasons but most importantly: they ate bitterballen with a fork. and dipped them in ketchup (but that was too long for the poem). apparently you dip them in mosterd but i dont like mosterd so i dont dip them in anything lmao. but yeah technically it doesnt *begin* with a fun fact.<br>its also a bit like. okay i get why theyre annoyed, i get annoyed when the dutch call "frietjes" "patat" like girl what are you saying. but also this seems like an odd thing to write an article about given the current state of the world? but then again, maybe we feel better thinking about stuff like this than like. for example one of our ministers taking money for social services and putting it into defension. ngl i get it. but yeah my news mail was like "trump tariffs bad" "social services? nah" "belgian apples not doing good" "belgian farmers not doing good" "OH GOD THEY ATE BITTERBALLEN WITH KETCHUP"</details>
