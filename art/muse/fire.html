                     <u>week of jan 13th:</u> living in california, it's hard not to be thinking about fire right now. think about a moment you've had with fire or explore how fire can be beautiful, dangerous, natural, harmonious, destructive, growth-inducing, tragic, etc<br>written on 16/02/2025. <br><br>
                    <table><tr>
                    <td>i see the fire and i think of<br>how close the water is<br>getting to my toes. i <br>google in how many years<br>i will share my room<br>with mussels and shrimp<br>the difference that 14 hours and 1.5Â°C make.</td></tr>
                    </table>                
                    <details><summary>unleash the thought process</summary><p>i havent been feeling very creative lately and everything i make is trash. i didn't feel too bad about this one and i really wanted to do another entry. it isn't really about fire, but about the different effects of climate change. last year family members had to walk home from school, knee deep in the water. a couple years ago me and my siblings donated half of our toys and books and bought food and drinkable water for victims of a giant flood in the south of my country. in about 30 years, the city im currently going to school in, will be sea. it makes me sad. in the years after that, my home, my family's homes, the places i grew up in, will all be sea. it makes me very sad and angry and scared. idk. sorry if it doesnt fit the theme correctly but i wanted to share so here it is. (14 hours is the time it takes to fly from my country to LA) </details>
