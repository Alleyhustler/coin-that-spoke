     				    <b>week of 13/05/2024. prompt: write about evolution and devolution. how do we unravel & re-ravel? think about what histories our bodies & communities & species & worlds are made of.</b>
     				    <p>written on 15/05/2024. <a href="../../crea/images/evolution.html" target="_blank">here's my notebook page.</a>
                <details><summary>unleash the thought process</summary><p>i was thinking about the prompt while walking to school and was thinking "yknow it would be amazing if through evolution trans guys won't have tits in the future if they don't want them" (the past few weeks i've been feeling pretty dysphoric, just so you know where this is coming from lol) and i was going that way, but i didn't want it to be too clich√©. so i kept it vague i guess? if you don't know what i had in the back of my mind while writing it, i don't think you'd guess. maybe i'm wrong who am i to say.<br><br>the "going through" just means going through evolution except i just left that word out. <br>"home" in the first block means stars/stardust. <br>"If I go first" again, through the evolution. i left the word out again. i'm sensing a pattern guys<br>"i don't have my dictionary with me" as in i (or the I-persona) don't know what home is. <br>and i bought bread pudding yesterday and that was my breakfast and it made me happy and i thought, maybe this is home. it's something my mom makes sometimes. and i only ever eat tangerines at home because then i can use a knife to open them because jesus fuck those things ARE hard to open. idk how yall do it.<br>"i keep spinning at the wheel" i don't remember why i wrote this. i was half paying attention to geography and half writing this hah. i guess i meant i try to keep working or keep going for this evolution, maybe in rights or justice or whatever so the next generations of trans people or queer people or just people in general will have it a bit easier. but like it's scary and things are happening so much and nothing seems to happen, so maybe i meant that.<br>and then the god part. i'm not religious but religious poetry is one of my favourite to be honest. it's so raw. but like a typical thing that's said in religious households (or so i've heard) is that god is always there, always watching. but does god ever change? we don't know. i was feeling a bit sad about it. i wrote "friends" as "Friends" because it's important. if god is written with a capital letter, why not his friends?<br>the slash things are because i felt funky? i guess. it looks cool. it's like "OKAY THE POEM STOPS HERE." except it just keeps going. sadly not forever though that would be cool.<br><br>i probably sought too much behind my own words but that's kinda it i think? it's a bit short but i'm proud of it.</details>
