     				    <b>week of 29/04/2024. currrent prompt: write about or use asymmetry in your writing. what is the intrigue in imbalance? maybe work with different-sized stanzas or long, long sentences followed by short ones, or think about how no two bodies are the same, nor two halves of the same body, or how the feeling of a painting shifts with where the objects sit.</b>

                <details><summary>unleash the thought process</summary><p>this is inspired by two poems! i don't remember what they were called or who wrote them, but one's a poem about god talking to someone. you can't read what the person says, but god keeps replying. maybe it was the other way around i'm not sure. and the other one was about an astronaut i believe?<br> anyways, i wanted a more theater play kind of thing because i'm an incorrigible theater kid. if you look at the html file (or read this) you'll see that the first person is called the Answerer, and the second person the Questioner. <br>now how did i actually start writing this? in my science class my teacher got angry about none of us writing down notes and then i quickly typed what was on the blackboard and showed it to him. yep that's just my science notes that i have, since writing this, deleted. if you read the sententces in the opposite direction, you'll see what i'm supposed to be learning. side note the ".noitcartsbA", ".ereht dna ereH", "abcAstontir" and "Your blood is your blood." are things that i came up with, together with everything the Questioner says. <br>originally i was gonna go with the clear format but i thought i'd get there by making the objects float. i did not get there but instead i got the unclear version which is fucking cool. i made a clear version so people can actually read it if they want to. i had so much fun making this :)</p></details>
