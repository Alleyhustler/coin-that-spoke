		i am in no way a professional. i am just a 17 year old boy with an interest in art and history and arthistory so like. check some other sources if you're interested :) i am in middle school and one of my classes is art history, just so you know most if not all of this information doesn't come from wikipedia (though, for bigger artists wikipedia <i>can</i> be a good source!)<br><br>
    this is my page, and i choose which ones to include. on some pages you might find a note to look some artists up on wikipedia if i don't want to talk about them. most of the time these people are very famous for some reason so you'll often find a good wikipedia page or a shitload of articles about them.
    <br><br>

my classes aren't in english, so i apologize for any mistakes here! feel free to let me know in my guestbook or neocities profile. also if you like an artists and you'd like to recommend them to me, pleaaaase let me know i love learning :P<br><br>

these pages are heavily work in progress, so please be patient if something doesn't seem to work or isn't filled in ^^
