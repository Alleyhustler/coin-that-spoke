                        this was when my mom & aunt were sick so i went to a festival with my cousin in their place! i wasn't prepared at all and honestly didn't know them very well, but it was so good! <i>florence welsh</i> is so angelic like wow
                        </details>
                        <details><summary><i>harry styles (+ wet leg)</i></summary>
                        originally my mom got tickets for me and my cousin, but my cousin's not a fan lol. i'm not either anymore, but i think my younger self would be so happy if they knew i saw him live! i went with a friend and like rah. it was a bit claustrophobic because it was outside and you just. couldn't see where the exit was because there were so many people! that was kinda scary and i almost had a panic attack. luckily my friend helped me and we found a little spot where i we had space to breathe and move around! i'm still glad i went.

                        <details><summary><i>hozier (+ the last dinner party)</i></summary>
                        IT WAS SO GOOD!!!! live laugh <i>hozier</i> i swearrr his voice!!!!! i literally started screaming when he played like real people do like omfgg. i went together with my cousin DURING EXAM WEEKS. no idea how i managed to convince my parents but i'm so glad i went it was fucking trancendent. <i>the last dinner party</i> was also super good, i didn't know them very well but they were amazing to see live.

                        <details><summary><i>johannes is zijn naam (+ de witte kunst)</i></summary>
                        this was really fun!! he's a belgian artist mainly known for his work with <i>the van jets</i> (great band) and is now building his solo career :) i went with my dad and i was kind of stressed about having to stand up and not knowing how many people would be there, but it was very chill and i really enjoyed it! just a bit sad he used a lot of flashing lights so i had to close my eyes often :( <br><i>de witte kunst</i> was the support act and they were also very good and funny :)<br><br>
                        (not sure if this is needed, but <i>johannes is zijn naam</i> = johannes is his name ; <i>de witte kunst</i> = the white art )

                        <details><summary><i>bears in trees (+ the happy fits)</i></summary>
                        OH MY FUCKING GOD IT WAS SO GOOD. i got a shit ton of merch, callum george and iain signed my shirt, i got a picture with iain and they also signed my vinyl (which was already signed by the four of them when i bought it so now it's double signed TvT) i also got a picture with iain and gave them my little paper airplanes (they said they were gonna use them on the bus later) AND i high fived callum during the show TvT<br><br>
                        it was so so so fun they're so important to me. i've been listening to them since like 2020 which is the longest time i've continuously listened to a band. i'm so glad my dad went with me because without him i wouldn't have had them sign things and all that ^^<br><br>
                        <i>bears in trees</i> was actually the supporting act for <i>the happy fits</i>, but i'm not that big of a fan of them to be honest. still, the show was good and the vibes were vibing. i had to go outside for a bit during the main act because i was getting overwhelmed, but i'm really thankful it was in the caf√© and not the big place because otherwise i wouldn't have been able to do that mskfljmqs.<br>
                        i'm so so so thankful i was able to see them and i really really hope i'll be able to see them again ^-^

                        <details><summary><i>bikini kill (+ big joanie)</i></summary>
                        yall we (me & a friend) got the fucking <i>big joanie</i> setlist. holy shit. it was so so so cool, the Vibes!!! i'm so glad i could go and everyone was super nice and!!! <br>
                        i was really scared i was going to get a major sensory overload because a) we were AT THE FRONT b) the wheelchair places were RIGHT IN FRONT OF THE BOXES and c) idk things happen but i didnt get a sensory overload so yippee! shoutout to my dad for giving me his ear defenders he uses for work, without those i probably would Not have been able to handle all that. but it was super fun, not too many/fast flashing lights, afterwards people quickly made way so we could pass with the wheelchair (i've been friends with the person i went with for a long time and that has literally never happened holy shit) the battlejackets were SO COOL, we got tshirts, we got patches, i was able to move through the people quickly to get extra water & the waitress recognised me from the first time lmao. it was super super fun<br><br>
                        i didn't know <i>big joanie</i> beforehand, but they were super nice to us (they were at the merch stand) and their stage presence is sooo fucking good. if they come to my country again (and if i have the money) ill definitely go again!!<br><br>
                        and <i>bikini kill</i> holy shit. yeah. i dont have the words for it. it was very very good. it was so cool to see the band that got me into punk music in the first place live and hear them play my favourite songs and see them be silly on stage and i'm very very happy i was able to go :)

                        <details><summary><i>bluai (+ ciska ciska)</i></summary>
                        my dad's a fan of them and he asked if i wanted to go with him and i said yes :) i really enjoyed both the bands + there was space to sit down for which my knees were very grateful haha. <i>ciska ciska</i> doesn't have any music released yet but they're working on their first ep, and <i>bluai</i> has an album and a few singles & eps out! i highly highly recommend listening to them :D
