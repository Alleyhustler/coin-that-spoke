		<div class="left"><h2>info</h2><p>this is what they call their "second debut album". it's a new start of some sort, i think. seeing them play these songs live was absolutely majestic. i tried to convince my dad to learn the hot chocolate choreo (and failed) but in the end almost nobody danced at the show which was a bit sad tbh. my favourites are definitely henry says, all you get is confetti and i wanna feel calm, though they're all bangers. even my mom likes the album, and that's saying something!
