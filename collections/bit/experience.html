		<h1>my experience</h1><br>
		<i>2020</i>
		<p>i first listen to <a>ramblings of a lunatic</a>. i don't remember how i found it, though it was probably through tiktok. i think i might've put good rhymes for bad times on my playlist as well in this time period.
		</p>
		<i>2021</i>
		<p><a>and everybody else smiled back</a> comes out. i listen to the album. i like it. i slowly start adding more and more songs to my playlists.
		</p>
		<i>2022</i>
		<p><a>percipitation</a> and <a>every moonbeam every feverdream</a> come out. i remember sitting in gym and waiting for class to end so i could listen to the ep in peace. i start listening to more and more different types of music, but bears in trees is a constant one. i start calling them my favourite band.
		</p>
		<i>2023</i>
		<p><a>cassiopeia</a> is released on the first of september, <a>apathy is boring</a> towards the end of the month. this part of the school year was not very good for me, but music helped me calm down and feel slightly better. i did listen to more punk and metal at school because those are better for blocking out the sounds of the outside world. but in my room, when i was panicking or crying or feeling whatever big emotions i was feeling, i'd listen to bears in trees.
		</p>
		<i>2024</i>
		<p>the year starts with a new single released in january: <a>things that look like mistakes</a>. the second part of the school year was a lot better. they announced a european tour, and i was able to go (<a href="../../music/concerts.html">see here for more!</a>) ^-^ after that, they release <a>hot chocolate</a>, <a>i wanna feel calm</a> and <a>we don't speak anymore</a> as singles. their second debut album <a>how to build an ocean: instructions</a> is released on 26 april 2024.
        </p>
		<i>2025 (now)</i>
		<p>last year i listened to a *lot* of music, and a lot of new music as well. this year, this wasn't the case, as i had my graduation project and i cannot work/draw while listening to music. but when i did listen to music, it was most often bears in trees. they have a special place in my heart, and their music still brings me comfort.<br>
        so far this year they have released <a>left, right, goodnight</a> and <a>no love, no heartbreak</a>.
