		<h1>bears in trees</h1>
		<p>the one and only dirtbag boyband.</p>
		<p>bears in trees is an indie band from south london. they kinda reject genre labels, preferring to call themselves a dirtbag boyband. they've been called folk punk in the past and sometimes call themselves an emo band, though more recently they've been saying they're leaning into the pop genre. they kinda sound like you're walking in the city and find treasures under rocks and leaves and in flower pots and trash cans and a few of the treasures are gifted to you by a raccoon.
		<br><br>
		they have made 1 studio album, 2 debut albums, a lot of singles and eps, and a collection of songs only found on bandcamp and soundcloud. they're very active on social media and their promotion tiktoks are genius.<br><br>
		i saw them live on 10/05/2024 ^-^ (see <a href="../music/concerts.html">here</a> for more info!)
